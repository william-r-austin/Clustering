- Basic k-means
  - basic operations (centers + assignments)
  - initialization
  - Talk about empty clusters

Cluster evaluation
- SSE


----------------------------

dimensionality reduction
- Many techniques did not work because the data is not labeled.
- PCA vs downsampling.


preprocessing! (Normalized Iris DAta)
Downsampling Image data
- Convert Image dataset from uint8 to float


tuning t-SNE - Show Charts!!
- Perplexity
- Learning Rate
- # of Components - did not work!
Talk about MNIST - show images

mention running time + approximate big-oh.

Mention that labeled data may be helpful.



Left to do.
-----------
1. Iris dataset - use tnse, standard scaling, compare basic vs bisecting.
2. Compare initialization type.

3. Image dataset - Basic vs. Bisecting
